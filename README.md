# Timer
There is so many countdown script/exe/website what you can use if you want, but i decided made my own for one reason.
All other devs maid countdown _(for at least what i found)_ has too much features. I wanted to make simple and **user friendly** program and then share it.

# System Requirements
* OS: Windows
* DLL: Newtonsoft.Json.dll
* Net version: +3.5

Feel free copy my source code and check how i do it.
Happy coding & streaming!
