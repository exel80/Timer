# Timer
There is so many countdown script/exe/website what you can use if you want, but i decied make my own for one reason.
All other devs maid countdown (for at least what i found) has too much features. I wanted to make simple and user friendly program and then share it.

Feel free copy my source code and check how i do it.
Happy coding & streaming!
